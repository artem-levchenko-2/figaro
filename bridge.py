    127.0.0.1 only keeps other machines out, not other tabs.

    Two checks:
      * Origin — local clients (curl, the figaro CLI) never send this header.
        A browser always does on cross-origin requests, so its mere presence
        means the request came from a page. This blocks CSRF, including the
        "simple request" trick of posting JSON as text/plain to dodge preflight.
        The plugin's window reports "null", and so does a sandboxed iframe on
        any page: "null" passes only for a window of Figma's desktop app
        (FIGMA_APP), or a page could stand in for the plugin, read the board
        and answer the agents' scripts in its place.
      * Host — a page whose DNS is re-pointed at 127.0.0.1 (DNS rebinding)
        becomes same-origin with the bridge and could then read responses.
        Pinning Host to the loopback names we actually serve closes that.

    Then the token: every endpoint that changes a file or runs code wants the
    secret the bridge wrote to its token file (figaro_token.py). A local process
