# Pitfalls of Figaro and the Figma Plugin API

Read the `hint:` in the answer first: the bridge knows most of the cases below.

## Connection and the queue

| What you see | What it is | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `connection: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted` | your own sandbox keeps commands off the network, 127.0.0.1 included (Codex, Cursor) | run `figaro` outside the sandbox: ask the user to approve that, and to allow `figaro` for good |
| `missing or wrong X-Figaro-Token` (401) | the command didn't find the token the bridge saved when it started: it runs with another home folder (a sandbox, another user), or the file was removed | nothing ran. `figaro doctor` names the file and what to do; in a sandbox, run `figaro` outside it |
| `port 8788 on 127.0.0.1 is held by another program, not the Figaro bridge` | another program listens on the bridge's port and didn't answer `GET /` as the bridge does. The command sent it nothing (no token) and started no bridge | nothing ran. Tell the user: `lsof -nP -iTCP:8788 -sTCP:LISTEN` shows who listens; it has to stop, since the plugin connects to 8788 only. Don't kill it yourself |
| `plugin not connected` (503), "open … in Figma and run … Figaro there" | the plugin is not running in that file | tell the user: open the link in Figma and run Plugins → Development → Figaro (⌘⌥P repeats the last plugin). Then `figaro wait -T …`, not a loop of retries |
| `N files connected — specify a target` (409), "ambiguous" | several files, and no target or an ambiguous one | `-T` with a key or a link; `figaro targets` |
| `file busy` (503) | another agent has held the file longer than `--queue-timeout` | nothing ran — retry later; the message says who holds it |
| `Figaro is updating` (503) | the user pressed Update in the plugin's window: the bridge pulls the new version and restarts | nothing ran — run the command again in ~10 s |
| `(waited 4.2s in the file's queue)` | you waited in the queue | normal; keep your scripts short so others don't wait for you |
| 504 timeout | the script didn't finish within `--timeout` — most often a long `for … of` loop without `h.ck()` | it may still be running and writing: tell the user in your first line. `figaro wait -T …` returns once it has ended (the file answers 409 until then); look at the result with `inspect` or `shot` before you retry, and use smaller batches. `figaro clear -T …` only once you know it has ended |
| `Figma isn't answering in "…"` (from `figaro wait`; the file is red in the plugin's window) | a script there runs on long past its time, or the plugin's window closed while one ran | tell the user in your first line: reload the file in Figma (close its tab and open it again, or quit Figma if the tab won't close), then run Figaro in it. Don't retry until `figaro wait` says it is ready |
| `the loop on line N was still running when --timeout ran out — the script was stopped` | a `while` or `for (;;)` loop never ended: its condition stayed true | the file is free. What the script changed before stays: look at it, or `figaro undo`. Fix the condition, so that what it tests changes each time round |
| `figma.…() did not answer before --timeout ran out — the script was stopped` | Figma never answered the call on the line it names | the file is free, but don't repeat that call. It happens with `figma.teamLibrary` and import by key — take what the file already has by id from `figaro inspect` |
| `plugin disconnected mid-request` | the plugin restarted (Figma restarted it after a code change, or the user closed its window) | check what the script managed to do (`inspect`) and run it again; `undo` remembers nothing from before a restart |
| `⚠ … runs an older build — figaro reload` | Figma runs old plugin code | `figaro reload -T <file>`; if that fails, ask the user to press Reload in the plugin's window or to restart the plugin |
| `⚠ Figaro X is released (this is Y) — tell the user` | a new release is out, and the user hasn't skipped it in the window | tell the user once, in your report. Don't update Figaro yourself unless they ask: the window's Update waits until no agent's script runs |
| the first call is slow, "the plugin has not connected yet" | the bridge has just started, and a Figma window in the background takes up to a minute to connect | retry in a few seconds |
| `zsh: = not found` | the command line starts with `=` (`echo ======`) | use `echo ---` as a divider |

## Ids and files

- **`no node 12:34 in "…"`** — a layer from another file (check `-T`) or a deleted one. The id in a link is
  `node-id=12-34` → `12:34`; Figaro understands both.
- **Ids inside an instance** (`I12:3;4:5`) change when the instance is detached or gets another component.
  After `detachInstance()` or `swapComponent()` find layers again from a stable parent.
- **Search by id, not by name**, when other people edit the file: a name may change between your calls.
- `findOne(n => n.name.startsWith("06"))` also finds a text "06" — limit the search to `root.children` or a
  `type`.

## Auto-layout

The helpers `h.frame`, `h.fill`, `h.hug`, `h.fixed` and `h.wrapText` already do everything in the right
order. If you write it by hand:

- **The order**: `layoutMode` → `resize()` → sizing modes. Padding, spacing and alignment can be set at any
  point, and so can `appendChild` — before `layoutMode` or after, with children already inside (checked live:
  none of it was lost). What is lost is a size: turning `layoutMode` on makes the main axis HUG, so a frame
  resized to 200×100 first ends up 200 wide and as tall as its children with `"VERTICAL"`, and 100 tall and
  as wide as its children with `"HORIZONTAL"`. `resize()` after the mode, then HUG or FIXED.
- **`resize()` fixes the axes whose size it changes.** `resize(200, 100)` on a hugging frame fixes both;
  `resize(200, node.height)` fixes the width and leaves the height hugging. Same for a text: a new width alone
  gives `textAutoResize = "HEIGHT"`, a new height alone `"NONE"`. On a FILL child, the axis it changes turns
  FIXED and the other keeps FILL. Size first, modes after; or `h.fixed(node, w, null)`.
- **FILL** — only for a child of an auto-layout frame, and only after `appendChild`: before it, Figma throws
  "node must be an auto-layout frame or a child of an auto-layout frame". A FILL child of a HUG parent
  collapses: give the parent FIXED or FILL.
- **HUG** — only for an auto-layout frame or a text.
- **`counterAxisAlignItems` has no `STRETCH`**: to stretch a child across, `h.fill(child, "x")`.
- **The text turned into a column one character wide** — its width is 0: `h.wrapText(text)` in auto-layout or
  `h.wrapText(text, 320)`. Check `width > 0` afterwards.
- **A FIXED frame clips new children** when it has `clipsContent`: after adding them, HUG on that axis.
- **An absolute child** (`layoutPositioning = "ABSOLUTE"`) can't FILL; badges and overlays — yes, the rest —
  no.
- **Don't mix** `layoutSizingHorizontal/Vertical` (`FIXED`, `HUG`, `FILL`) with `primaryAxisSizingMode` /
  `counterAxisSizingMode` (`FIXED`, `AUTO`): they are two ways of saying the same thing.

## Text and fonts

- **`unloaded font`** — the font isn't loaded: `h.setText`, or `h.fonts(node)` before editing text
  properties.
- **`could not be loaded`** — this font isn't installed on this computer. `h.fonts(node)` tells you which are
  missing.
- **Icon fonts** (Font Awesome and the like): an icon is a text holding the glyph's name (`chart-network`);
  in a font that isn't installed it shows as letters stacked in a column, "S O L I D". The fix is to switch
  `fontName` to an installed icon font and leave the text alone. `h.fa()` lists the installed Font Awesome
  fonts.
- **Mixed fonts** (`fontName === figma.mixed`) — `h.setText` and `h.fonts` load them; new text takes the
  first character's style. To keep the formatting of parts, edit by ranges (`helpers.md`).
- **Text in an instance**: when the component has a TEXT property, change it with
  `h.variant(inst, {Label: "…"})`, not through `characters` inside — that keeps the link to the property.
- **Timeouts on bulk text** (2 to 5 minutes in past runs): ~25 layers per script, and fonts once at the start
  (`h.fonts(root)`).
- A text style's font must be loaded too before you set the style: `h.fonts([text.fontName,
  style.fontName])`.
- **A text style replaces what a text already has.** On a text with its own look, `setTextStyleIdAsync`
  swaps the font, size, line height, letter spacing, case and decoration for the style's, and flattens
  formatting inside the line (a bold word turns regular); a new text just takes the style whole. So on an
  existing text attach a style when its properties already match, or when changing them is the point.
  Compare the main ones first:
  `["fontName", "fontSize", "lineHeight", "letterSpacing", "textCase", "textDecoration", "paragraphSpacing",
  "paragraphIndent", "listSpacing", "leadingTrim"].every((k) => JSON.stringify(text[k]) ===
  JSON.stringify(style[k]))`. A text with mixed ranges (`getStyledTextSegments` returns more than one
  segment) keeps its formatting only without the style: leave it and say that no style fits.
- **`textTruncation` and `maxLines` cut a text that has more lines than the limit, and the box follows.**
  Checked on `WIDTH_AND_HEIGHT`: a text of three `\n` lines, 45 px tall, with `"ENDING"` and `maxLines = 2`
  came out 30 px; a one-line text has nothing to cut, so nothing seems to happen. `maxHeight` cuts the same
  way (and switches truncation to `ENDING` itself, leaving `maxLines` `null`), but only on a text inside an
  auto-layout frame: elsewhere it throws "Can only set maxHeight on auto layout nodes and their children".
  Changing `textAutoResize` afterwards resets truncation and `maxLines` (`DISABLED`, `null`), and a text
  that grew to 700 px keeps that width. Set truncation before `maxLines`: `"ENDING"` makes `maxLines` 1,
  and a `maxLines` set while truncation is off is dropped without an error. On `NONE` truncation turns the
  mode into the legacy `TRUNCATE`, and `maxLines` stays `null`. For a paragraph that wraps:

  ```js
  await h.wrapText(title, 240);      // HEIGHT, 240 px wide (in auto-layout: no width, it fills the parent)
  title.textTruncation = "ENDING";   // first: it sets maxLines to 1
  title.maxLines = 2;                // then the number of lines — checked: two lines, 30 px tall
  ```

## Fills, variables, styles

- **`'color' is read-only`**, **`object is not extensible`** — `fills`, `strokes`, `effects` and the paints in
  them are frozen: copy the array (`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(node.fills))`), change it and assign it whole.
  To bind — `h.bF`/`h.bS`.
- **`setBoundVariableForPaint` returns a new paint** — it has to be assigned; `h.bF` does that itself.
- **Empty `fills`** — nothing to bind: first `node.fills = h.solid("#000")`, then `h.bF(node, 0, v)`.
- **A fill's opacity** lives in `paint.opacity`, not in the variable's colour: don't lose it when you
  overwrite the fill.
- **What the file already has — by id, not by key.** The components, styles and variables (its own and its
  libraries') that the file's layers use, `figaro inspect` prints with their ids:
  `(await h.node(id)).createInstance()`, `setFillStyleIdAsync(id)`, `h.bF(node, 0, id)`. Import by key takes
  only what is published in a library enabled for the file. In a draft it may fail even for what the file
  already uses: `importStyleByKeyAsync` never answers, and a variable fails with
  `could not find variable with key`.

## Components

- **`New parent is an instance`** — an instance can't take new layers. A one-off state — `inst.detachInstance()`
  and edit inside (a house rule); a change for everyone — in the main component.
- **`clone()` loses `componentPropertyReferences`** — hook the properties up again after cloning.
- **A nested instance's properties don't show on the parent** until `nested.isExposedInstance = true`.
- **`addComponentProperty` returns the full name** (`Label#12:0`) — keep it, don't guess it.
- **After `combineAsVariants` the variants lie on top of each other** — lay them out in a grid.
- **`Could not find a component property with name`** — `setProperties` wants the full name with the emoji
  and the `#id` (`✒️ Label#164:0`; `inspect` of the set prints them). Use `h.variant(inst, {Label: "…"})` or
  `figaro variant`: they find the full name from a short one (`Label`) or from the `#id` (`Label#164:0`).
- **`resetOverrides`** is deprecated — use `removeOverrides`.
- **Figma records every `addComponentProperty` as a separate Cmd+Z step.** `undo` and `-R` go back step by
  step until everything the script created is gone. Properties added to an **existing** component can't be
  checked that way — `undo` warns; compare with `inspect`.
- **`inst.mainComponent = other` drops the overrides**, `inst.swapComponent(other)` keeps them.

## Scripts

- **The answer is `Done` or `null`** — you forgot the `return`.
- **Scripts run in strict mode.** `'x' is not defined` — declare it first (`const`, `let`). `'x' is read-only`
  for a variable — it is a `const`: declare it with `let` to give it a new value. `no setter for property` —
  the property can only be read: `width` and `height` change with `resize()` or `h.fixed`.
- **`not a function`** — the method was renamed or exists only as an async version (`getNodeByIdAsync`,
  `setTextStyleIdAsync`, `getMainComponentAsync`). Check the name.
- **`figma.createAutoLayout()`, `node.query()`, `node.set()` and `node.screenshot()`** from Figma's own advice
  exist only in its MCP server — the Plugin API doesn't have them, and calling one fails with `not a function`.
- **`… permission not specified in manifest`** — Figaro doesn't let scripts see who is in the file:
  `figma.currentUser`, `figma.activeUsers` and the authors of FigJam stamps are off. Leave them out, and don't
  edit Figaro's `manifest.json`.
- **Building needs no `figma.setCurrentPageAsync`**: `figma.create*()` puts a node on the current page, and
  `page.appendChild(node)` or `h.frame(page, …)` moves it where it belongs; to read another page,
  `await page.loadAsync()`. A switched page jumps on the user's screen — don't switch it unless they ask.
- **While a script runs, Figma is busy with it**: it doesn't repaint, and nothing else gets in — even a
  `--parallel` read waited until a 10 s script was over. `h.ck()` or `--timeout` ends your script, but
  nothing makes Figma responsive before that: batches of a few seconds.
- **Search inside a node, never `figma.root.findAll` or `figma.currentPage.findAll`** on a file you don't know
  the size of. In a large design file (hundreds of thousands of layers) one such call freezes Figma for tens
  of seconds. Start from the frame you work on (`(await h.node(id)).findAll(…)`, `h.find(root, {…})`,
  `figaro find <layer> …`) and narrow by `type` (`findAllWithCriteria`).
- **A big `return`** (thousands of nodes) is slow: return only what you need.
- **An error in a `--lib` library** prints as `file.js, line N`; `libMissing` — the plugin restarted, and the
  CLI sends the library again by itself.

## Groups, sections, bounds

- **An empty group deletes itself.** Remove the last child of a group and the group is gone (`group.removed`
  is `true`); a later `group.remove()` or `group.children` throws `The node with id "…" does not exist`. To
  delete a group, remove the group, not its children. To empty it on purpose, check first:
  `if (!group.removed) group.remove();`.
- **A section never wraps its children.** It keeps its size however much you put in (a 900 px frame in a
  400×300 section sticks out), and a new one is 496×496. A child's `x` and `y` are relative to the section:
  `appendChild` keeps the numbers, not the place on the canvas. Size the section yourself after filling it —
  `resize` and `resizeWithoutConstraints` both work on it:

  ```js
  const pad = 80, kids = sec.children;
  const minX = Math.min(...kids.map((c) => c.x)), minY = Math.min(...kids.map((c) => c.y));
  const maxX = Math.max(...kids.map((c) => c.x + c.width)), maxY = Math.max(...kids.map((c) => c.y + c.height));
  for (const c of kids) { c.x += pad - minX; c.y += pad - minY; }
  sec.resizeWithoutConstraints(maxX - minX + 2 * pad, maxY - minY + 2 * pad);
  ```

  Sections sit on a page only, and have no auto-layout, constraints or `clipsContent`.
- **`absoluteRenderBounds` is cut by every parent that clips.** A 200×200 rectangle in a 100×100 frame with
  `clipsContent` has an `absoluteBoundingBox` of 200×200 and a render box of 100×100; fully cut off or hidden,
  it is `null`. It includes a shadow, though (a 100×100 frame with a drop shadow: 148×148) and a text comes
  out as its letters. For a layer's own box use `absoluteBoundingBox` or `width`/`height`. (A render box that
  lags behind the change inside one script wasn't reproduced for rectangles, text, effects and auto-layout:
  all were current at once.)

## Prototypes

- **Reactions go through `await node.setReactionsAsync([...])`.** Write `actions: [...]`: the old single
  `action` field is refused ("update the `actions` field instead of the `action` field"). A NAVIGATE needs
  another frame that sits straight on the page **or in a section** as the destination (checked: section to
  section, page to section and section to page all work); a frame nested in another frame is rejected with
  "destination … was rejected".

  ```js
  await a.setReactionsAsync([{ trigger: { type: "ON_CLICK" }, actions: [{
    type: "NODE", destinationId: b.id, navigation: "NAVIGATE", resetVideoPosition: false,
    transition: { type: "SMART_ANIMATE", easing: { type: "EASE_IN_AND_OUT" }, duration: 0.4 },
  }] }]);
  ```
- **Smart Animate pairs layers by name and type**, so the two states need the same layer names and the same
  properties on both sides. Make the second state a clone of the first (`a.clone()`: same names and types)
  and change only what moves. A property that exists in one state only doesn't animate: use opacity 0 instead
  of a missing fill, and a fixed size instead of HUG. (Only the API side of this was checked live: play the
  prototype to see the animation.)

## Annotations

- **`node.annotations` is a new array on every read**, with new items: `includes(item)` with an item from an
  earlier read never matches. Compare by label text, and read the array once into a variable.
- **`Only one of label or labelMarkdown should be given`** — an item read back has both, even one written as
  `{label}`, so what you read can't be written back as it is. That is why `[...node.annotations, {label}]`
  fails on a layer that already has an annotation, inside an instance or not. Drop `label` and keep the rest
  (`labelMarkdown`, `properties`, `categoryId`):
  `node.annotations = node.annotations.map(({label, ...rest}) => rest).concat([{label: "New"}])`.
- **`Setting an annotation with no content is invalid`** — an annotation needs a label or pinned
  `properties`. To remove them all: `node.annotations = []`.
- **Groups, sections and boolean layers have no annotations**: writing them there does nothing, and no error
  says so. `"annotations" in node` tells; put the note on a frame, a shape, a text or an instance.
- **An annotation on a hidden layer, or inside a hidden parent, doesn't show in Dev Mode.** `h.annotations`
  says `visible: false` for it.

## Undo

- **`undo` refuses another agent's script** (when both name themselves with `-A`); `--force` takes it back
  anyway — only if the user says so.
- **`undo` skips scripts that changed nothing**: right after one of them it undoes the script before. Read
  whose script and how long ago in the answer.
- **`undone: … (3 Cmd+Z steps)`** — Figma recorded the script as several steps, and all of them were undone.
  `⚠ not everything was undone` — look at what is left and tell the user.
- **Figma has one Cmd+Z for the whole file**: it undoes the last step, whoever made it.
- **`⚠ N changed in the file while the script ran … not by the script`** — the code only reads, so Figma or
  someone in the file made those changes, and nothing was rolled back. In a large file Figma updates
  instances on a page the first time a script loads it; the same script once more gives a clean answer.
  A script that only reads answers the moment it ends: what Figma updates right after it isn't in its
  answer, so no `⚠` line shows it.

## Pictures

- **`shot` captures what Figma shows**: a layer that sticks out of a frame with `clipsContent` comes out cut.
- **A picture takes in what sticks out of the layer**: a shadow, an outside stroke, the children of a frame
  that doesn't clip. A 200×100 card with a shadow comes out 248×148, and a text layer is cut to its letters
  (a 300×40 box holding "Hi" gives 10×9). `--absolute` (`h.shot(node, {absolute: true})`) gives exactly the
  layer's own box in every format: for a picture that goes into another mockup or must match the layer.
  To check that nothing sticks out, shoot without it.
- **Don't shoot a whole long page** — shoot it in sections: each one reads better. The CLI cuts a tall layer
  into parts of up to 1600 px.
- **Don't group or ungroup layers for an export**: that once dropped sections out of their frame. `shot`
  changes nothing in the file.
